## Short Description
In some cases, either due to misalignments, sample thickness or geometry, the diffraction pattern in each scan pixel acquired during a SPED experiment in a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) may shift relative to the other patterns. This repository contains python tools to fit a two dimensional gaussian to a subset of each diffraction pattern in order to find these relative shifts.

See the <a href="https://github.com/emichr/align_sped/blob/master/Doc/align_sped.pdf">Documentation</a> for details on each tool.

## Tasks
